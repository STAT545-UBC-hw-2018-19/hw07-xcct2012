knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,

)
```

_Note__: This package allows the user to access the 'powers' functions, which include pow(x), square(x), cube(x), and a boxcox(x) function that performs a Box-Cox transformation on any set of vectors.

If you are looking to streamline your use of power functions, then the 'powers' package is just what you're looking for!

```{r}
library(powers)
```

Want squares, cubes, or boxcox? Easily done.

```{r}
square(1:10)
cube(1:10)
boxcox(1:10)
```
